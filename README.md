# Project Goals and Objectives

The purpose of this project is to develop a web application that enables users to track their stock investments. The application should allow users to add information about the stocks they own, including the quantity of shares they hold, the buying and selling price, and the date of purchase. Additionally, the application should provide users with an analysis of their investment performance, including profit and loss calculations.

The application should provide users with real-time data on their stock prices, including information on how much the prices have gone up or down. Furthermore, the application should enable users to set alerts for specific stocks so that they receive SMS or email notifications when the prices rise or fall beyond a certain level.

The application should allow users to add notes to each stock, enabling them to track any additional information or observations related to their investments. Additionally, the application should provide users with an overall summary of their investment portfolio, including their profit and loss calculations.

Finally, the application should offer users the ability to create an account and log in using their email address, phone number, or social media accounts (via OAuth). This will ensure that the user's investment data is stored securely and that they can access it easily from any device.
